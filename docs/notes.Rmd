looks like we can do it from here
```
Creating and maintaining a PITCHf/x database is a breeze with pitchRx and dplyr
<http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/index.html>. With a few lines of
code (and some patience), all available PITCHf/x data can be obtained directly
from its source and stored in a local SQLite <http://www.sqlite.org/> database.
```
- [ ] Figure out how to tell which side the batter is on
